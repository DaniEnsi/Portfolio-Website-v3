## What's new?
The new blog has a few new features that I think you will love. Let's take a look at them.

## New design
The new design is more modern and cleaner than the old one. I think it's easier to read and navigate. I also added a dark mode, so you can read the articles in what ever setting you prefer.

## New search
The new search is much faster and more accurate than the old one. You can search for articles by title, description, and tags. You can also search for articles by date.

## New comment system
The new comment system is much more modern and easier to use than the old one. You can now comment on articles without having to log in. You can also reply to comments and like them.

## New article system
The new article system is much more modern and easier to use than the old one. You can now write articles in Markdown and use the editor to preview them. You can also add tags and a header image to your articles.
