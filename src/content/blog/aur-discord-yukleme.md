The ones to be described here are completely connected to the following page and cannot be done without the operations on that page.Please [bu sayfaya](/blog/octopi-aur-destegi-nasil-aktiflestirilir)Â Increase, activate AUR support and visit this page again.

In order to install Discord, we open the Octopi application and instead of searching `discord` We need to write.

As you can see in the picture, even though we call, nothing comes to our screen because the Discord package is not available in the official Manjaro warehouses, but there are thousands of packages in Arch user warehouses.In our previous article, I wrote that the search with aur will be done after clicking on the green alien head.Therefore, we click on the alien head to the left of the search location to search the package in aur warehouses.

As you can see in the picture, there are many different packages and versions in the aur warehouses, not only Discord.If you do not see the `Discord` package on the list, you can slide a little down.At the same time, if you want to use Discord Canary, you can install the following package.

To start the installation process, we right -click on the package we want to install as described in the `Pacaur` installation and select the" Upload "option.Unlike the previous one, the installation of the aur packages will be done in a console window, not in Octopia.So calm down and just wait for the installation to end.If you have not closed the 2 settings specified in the previous article, you may ask you a few questions.Since these questions will be Turkish, we think you will understand and continue.

After the installation is completed, as in the `Pacaur` package, the icon you see to the left of the package will be green and will verify that the package is loaded.You can now run your application menu or if you want to start the application using the `sub -` + `F2` method of KDE.
